## Development

To start your app in development mode and rebuild assets on file changes, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Open up http://localhost:3000 and you should be ready to go!

## Database

Modify the schema.prisma file to make changes to the database configuration. The current setup utilizes MongoDB with Prisma as the database management system. Adjust the schema.prisma file to manage the database settings.
